# Aviation_Accident_Database_Project
The aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and later about civil aviation accidents

## objectives
* to clean up the data
* to find out the number of accidents that have happened
* to find out how many passangers were injured or killed
* to find out the cause of the crashes
* What is the major contribution to accidents (pilot error or other)
* airline with the most accidents
* country with the most accidents

## Analysis
the data shows that there are more accidents than incidents as accidents make up of 95.6% of the crashes the data shows that majority of the accidents accur due to pilot error (due to probable cause) as weather conditions are mostly clear(VISIBLE CONDITIONS) accidents skyrocket during the landing pohase of the flight profesional airplanes and ameteur airplanes do not affect the data as it is pilot error that causes the crash.

A suggested solution is to train pilots more on landing and probably increase their mandatory flight hours on a training simulator
Most damage occurs on the non-amateur planes,although since the majority of the dataset is made up of non-amateur planes, there isn't significant data to prove which plane is safer(less damage occurs)

## Recomendations
* A suggested solution is to train pilots more on landing and probably increase their mandatory flight hours on a training simulator
* To encourage more pilots and airlines to make more reports as the data is mostly left blank, which is crucial to cracking down on incidents
